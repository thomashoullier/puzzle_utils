* Documentation
** Document standard functions
See https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/ranges

*** TODO Introduce what are ranges, views, algorithms over them

*** DONE Printing a range
CLOSED: [2023-10-20 Fri 18:33]
Basic thing.

*** DONE iota range factory
CLOSED: [2023-10-20 Fri 18:33]
+ See https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/ranges/iota_view
+ Run the example for real in an example section of the build.

*** TODO Create a range from a list of numbers manually.
initializer_list?

*** TODO filter range adaptor
+ See https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/ranges/filter_view

*** TODO fold_left
+ Used as a way to sum.

*** TODO accumulate

* Functions to implement
** TODO Create a library with its own namespace
** TODO Predicate for "is multiple of X"
We can do a variadic function, for multiple of X, Y, Z etc.

** TODO Unbounded sequence for Fibonacci
** TODO Printing a view
Implement a utility for printing views.
+ Features:
  + OK. Usage with the pipe syntax.
  + OK. Gives back the range at the other end of the pipe.
  + OK. Guard against infinite printing.
  + OK. Add the possibility of printing the first n elements for unbounded ranges.
  + OK. Replace std::enable_if_t with C++20 concepts.

* Maintenance
** HOLD Replace the external fmt library with the standard C++ when it becomes available
+ Use the C++23 <print> header when it becomes implemented in gcc.
