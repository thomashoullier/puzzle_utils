* Documentation
** Document standard functions
See https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/ranges

*** TODO Introduce what are ranges, views, algorithms over them

*** DONE Printing a range
CLOSED: [2023-10-20 Fri 18:33]
Basic thing.

*** TODO Document our ex_range_printing example

*** DONE iota range factory
CLOSED: [2023-10-20 Fri 18:33]
+ See https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/ranges/iota_view
+ Run the example for real in an example section of the build.

*** TODO Create a range from a list of numbers manually.
initializer_list?

*** TODO filter range adaptor
+ See https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/ranges/filter_view

*** TODO fold_left
+ Used as a way to sum.

*** TODO accumulate
* Test suite
** DONE Initiate the test suite.
CLOSED: [2023-10-24 Tue 21:31]
Create the test suite with the existing pzu library examples.

** TODO Add test coverage utility

** DONE Add the non-regression test case on print
CLOSED: [2023-10-25 Wed 19:18]
This is:

#+begin_src C++
  auto even = [](int i) { return 0 == i % 2; };
  std::views::iota(1,20) | std::views::filter(even) | pzu::rangePrinter;
#+end_src

** TODO Silence cout in the tests for RangePrinter
RangePrinter works as intended, we want it to output to cout and only there
for simplicity.
But we do not want it to add noise in the test report.

+ ~std::cout.rdbuf(NULL)~ does not work: we still see the same output.
+ ~std::cout.setstate(std::ios_base::failbit);~  does not work either.
+ Where does ~fmt::print~ goes by default?

* Functions to implement
** DONE Create a library with its own namespace
CLOSED: [2023-10-22 Sun 17:28]
** TODO Predicate for "is multiple of X"
Features:
+ Must be used like: ~| std::views::filter(pzu::is_multiple_of(5,3))~
+ We can do a variadic function, for multiple of X, Y, Z etc.
+ Generalize to all valid inputs for the ~%~ operator, try using an auto,
  or if it fails, an integral type.

** TODO Unbounded sequence for Fibonacci
** DONE Printing a view
CLOSED: [2023-10-22 Sun 17:28]
Implement a utility for printing views.
+ Features:
  + OK. Usage with the pipe syntax.
  + OK. Gives back the range at the other end of the pipe.
  + OK. Guard against infinite printing.
  + OK. Add the possibility of printing the first n elements for unbounded ranges.
  + OK. Replace std::enable_if_t with C++20 concepts.

* Maintenance
** HOLD Replace the external fmt library with the standard C++ when it becomes available
+ Use the C++23 <print> header when it becomes implemented in gcc.

** DONE Bug in RangePrinter
CLOSED: [2023-10-23 Mon 21:18]
The following does not seem to work:
~std::views::iota(1,20) | std::views::filter(is_multiple_of_2) | pzu::rangePrinter~

+ This is not a SizedRange since it does not know its size in constant time.
+ Add the bug to a non-regression test.

We have solved the bug by changing the print RangePrinter method from:
~print (const View auto &range)~ to ~print (View auto range)~.
I think the reason may be that some ranges do need to modify their state
in order to know their length?
